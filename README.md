## Problem Statement
The most common question asked in my household is, "What's for dinner?" 
As a single working mum, this question fills me with dread and takes up more time than I feel I have to decide, shopping for ingredients and then preparing the meal.

A place to share and find recipes to help reduce the mealtime dread.

## Known Bugs



<img src="ReadMe/Images/error.png" alt="recipe form not uploading">

The units and measurements do not look correct for a recipe, the ingredients should by in fractions and have an option for "to taste".
